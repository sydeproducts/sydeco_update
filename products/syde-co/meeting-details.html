										<h4>ALL IN ONE</h4>
									</a>
									<p class="description">
										<strong>All-IN-ONE</strong> is THE IT Security Solution from PT SYDECO it is based on the principles
										of ZERO-TRUST and is designed to prevent cyber-attacks such as Ransomware or data breaches, in the
										event of an attack, allowing computer networks to continue to function by preventing viruses or
										worms have any effect and prevent lateral contamination in the tissue.
										<br><br><strong>All-IN-ONE</strong> IT Security Solution from PT Sydeco focuses on protecting the
										resources (all data and computing services) of an establishment or enterprise, such as assets, data,
										services, workflows, networks. Sydeco's ALL-IN-ONE IT Security Solution protects all enterprise
										assets (devices, applications, virtual and cloud components) and subjects (end users, applications
										and other non-human entities requesting information from resources).
										<br><br><strong>All-IN-ONE</strong> Cybersecurity Solution from PT Sydeco secures all
										communications, all data transfers regardless of where the network is located. All-IN-ONE IT
										Security Solution from PT Sydeco is fully auditable, so that the state of assets as well as the
										integrity and security posture of all owned and related assets can be observed.
										<br><br>PT Sydeco's ALL-IN-ONE IT Security Solution, thanks to its Micro Segmentation Architecture
										to reduce the attack surface, limits attack impact and prevents lateral contamination within the
										enterprise.
										<br>

										<br>Figure 1: ALL-IN-ONE (Archangel, SP-One & SST) protect <strong>Programs and Data</strong>
									</p>
									<p> <strong>A. Network Security</strong>
										<br><br>
										The company's computer network, in any enterprise or establishment is protected by
										<strong>ARCHANGEL©</strong>, an advanced firewall created by PT SYDECO which is one of the
										components of the All-IN-ONE IT Security Solution.
										<br><br>
										<strong>ARCHANGEL©</strong> protects servers, computers and other connected objects from
										cyber-attacks originating from the outside world and prevents the spread of lateral virus
										contamination within the company.
										<br><br>
										Servers, computers that are on the company's internal network and which are connected to
										<strong>ARCHANGEL©</strong> itself are protected by SP-One©.
										<br><br>
										<strong>SP-One©</strong>, which is another component of the ALL-IN-ONE IT Security Solution, is a
										program and system that creates an airtight, secure shelter around source code or programs used in
										office, administration, or university computer networks. Cloud and in SaaS.
										<br><br>
										SP-One© protects servers, programs or Source Code against any cyber-attacks from the outside world
										and against those coming from within private computer network.
										<img src="assets/images/gambar 2.png">
										<br>
										Figure 2: ALL-IN-ONE (Archangel, SP-One & SST) protect <strong>Servers</strong>
									<p>
										Enterprise computer network security is enhanced by the ALL-IN-ONE <strong>Micro Segmentation
											Architecture</strong>. Thanks to the Micro Segmentation Architecture, users can only access the
										servers they need to work on and after being registered as authorized users.
										<br><br>
										<img src="assets/images/gambar 4.png">
										<br>Figure 3: Zero Trust & Micro Segmentation protect programs <strong>against lateral
											contamination</strong>
										<br><br>
										It follows that if a user accidentally or intentionally contaminates his computer, the virus or worm
										he has downloaded can only try to attack the server he is connected to. And this server is protected
										by SP-One, so not only the user will not be able to infect the server connected to it but also no
										other server in the network.
										<br><br>
										<strong>B. Mobile Data Security</strong>
										<br><br>
										All data moving within the internal network or outside, in the outside world, is protected by SST©,
										Secure System of Transmission, which is another creation of PT SYDECO, and delivered inside the VPN.
										<br><br>
										SST© protects data by encrypting it without using a key, without any third party intervention, using
										artificial intelligence to do so.
										<br><br>
										SST© also protects all passwords used in the All-IN-ONE IT Security System.
										<br><br>
										VPN are created by ARCHANGEL and encrypted by SST©.
										<br><br>
										This is E2E protection and only the receiver can read the data. The data will disappear if someone
										tries to intercept it.
										<br><br>
										<strong>C. Security On data at rest</strong>
										<br>
										<br>
										Backup Data is protected by SP-One and by Logic Micro Segmentation Architecture used by ALL-IN-ONE
										systems. Finally all data even when at rest, is encrypted by SST©.
										<br><br>
										<strong>D. Security Of The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Endpoints'</strong>
										<br><br>
										<strong>ALL-IN-ONE</strong> protects ICS endpoints from SCADA (Monitoring Control And Data
										Acquisition) or DCS (Distributed Control System) against worms such as StuxNet, or viruses such as
										ShaMoon or Trojan Horses such as BlackEnergy and will avoid disruptive activities or services.
										<br><br>
										<strong>ALL-IN-ONE</strong> protects <strong>ICS ENDPOINTS'</strong> as a whole, servers,
										communication networks through which data and instructions pass, data itself, terminals and
										individual components.
										<br><br>
										<strong>2. ZERO TRUST ARCHITERTURE </strong>
										<br><br>
										The ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE of the ALL-IN-ONE system, by partitioning the enterprise network into
										sub-systems, namely the enterprise network, control network and industrial network, which are
										separated from each other by security devices such as firewalls, ARCHANGEL ONE WAY, reduces the
										exposure of industrial infrastructure to threats and prepare systems for enhanced installation
										monitoring and incident detection.
										<br><br>
										Of course, the security of any device, any server, program, data, depends not only on the element of
										material protection but also and most importantly on respecting the strict policies governing access
										to the installation, its use and behavior in case of a problem.
										<img src="assets/images/Gambar 3.png">
										<br> Figure 4: Zero Trust Architecture & Micro segmentation of ALL-IN-ONE protect DATA: They are in
										a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
										<br><br>
										But, thanks to the <strong>ZERO TRUST</strong> architecture and the elements that made it up,
										including the <strong>ARCHANGEL ONEWAY</strong>, or <strong>SP-One</strong>, there will be no more:
										<br>
										<br>
										- Disruption in the services or operation of the ICS for example, due to blockage, delay in the flow
										of information, destruction or malicious encryption
										<br><br>
										- Unauthorized modifications to the system or its deactivation due to unfriendly penetrations or
										instructions that are illegal and harmful and which are of a nature such as to cause enormous human,
										material or financial damage,
