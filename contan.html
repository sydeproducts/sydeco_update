			  <h4>I - INTRODUCTION</h4>
			  <p>
			  <h5 align="justify">
							  <br>
							  The consensus in the literature is that 2021 will be the year of "Ransomware 2.0", with increasingly aggressive attacks (1): The Year of Extortion (2). 
							  Cyber attacks are expected to cost the world $11.4 million per minute in 2021.
<br>
<br>
								Some statistics show that the number of global ransomware attacks has increased by 50% compared to last year (1).

								Since 2020, there has been a clear trend towards more innovative, smarter malware, applications that look legitimate but are not, and social engineering that is becoming increasingly professional.
<br>
<br>
								Cyber attacks are becoming more aggressive, more targeted and more sophisticated, with attackers sourcing malware-as-a-service from underground forums (3) :
<br>
<br>
				   1. 	Routine services such as Remote Desktop Protocols (RDPs) and VPN hubs remain a preferred target for attacks at the network perimeter. Attackers use RDPs to move laterally within infiltrated networks (4),
				  <br>
				  <br>
				   2.   Attacks on servers: criminals are targeting server platforms that use both Windows and Linux and using them to attack companies from the inside (4),
				  <br>
				  <br>
				   3.   Attacks on managed service providers, small businesses and the cloud will increase,
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  4.    Cybercriminals will turn more to automation and the number of malware samples will increase (2).
								<br>
				  <br>
							It is therefore easy to understand that simple backup and traditional security solutions are no longer sufficient (2).<br>
<br>
				   1. 	Traditional antivirus software has to deal with frequent changes that require updates that are either late in coming or do not come, but that do not prevent the damage from being done,
				  <br>
				  <br>
				   2.   The firewall alone is no longer sufficient to counter the most sophisticated attacks, as hackers hide malware under deceptive appearances
				  <br>
				  <br>
				   Hence the need to implement epidemiologically inspired approaches to quantify cyber threats that have not been identified, detected or tracked in order to better address detection, risk assessment and prioritisation gaps (4)

					Hence, the need to check whether your current security system meets this approach, whether it is based on new technologies with performance commensurate with the risks involved.

					This approach is all the more necessary in Indonesia as Indonesia is currently known as the world's most vulnerable country that suffers cyber-attacks to their critical infrastructures. The government is working to change the current circumstances and build a stronger cyber defence against the nation's infrastructures (5).
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  <p><i>“In just 10 shorts months between January and October 2020, Indonesia’s National Cyber And Crypto Agency (Badan Siber dan Sandi Negara/BSSN) has detected a whopping 324 million cyber-attacks targeting Indonesia alone. Cyber-attacks on a global level has also increased tremendously in 2020. BSSN reports that the number of cyber-attacks have increased nearly six-fold compared to the numbers detected in 2019. The top 3 types of attacks are Phishing, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), and Ransomware. The other types of attacks include malware and web defacement attacks” (6).</i></p>
				  
				  <br>
				  <br>
				  </p>
				 <h4>II - CYBER-ATTACKS</h4>
				 <br>
				  <p>Cyber-attacks can cause significant disruption and damage even the most resilient organizations. Affected organizations will lose assets, reputation and business, and face fines and remediation costs.</p>

				  <p> With cyber threats constantly evolving, Cyber Security can be a complex undertaking. Due to the beneficial nature of successful cyber-attacks, cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their tactics, posing as an ongoing threat. Following are some of the Common Cyber-attacks and threats:</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 1. Phishing </font>
				  <p>Phishing, an old but still popular tactic, is a social engineering attack that tries to trick people into divulging sensitive or confidential information. It is not always easy to distinguish from the original message, these scams can inflict great damage on an organization.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 2. Social engineering </font>
				  <p>Social engineering comes in the form of more than just phishing, but is always used to trick and manipulate victims to gain information or gain access to their computers. This is achieved by tricking the user into clicking a malicious link or physically gaining access to the computer through the scam.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 3. DDOS (Distributed-of-service) attacks </font>
				  <p>A DDoS attack attempts to disrupt normal web traffic and take a site offline by flooding a system, server or network with more requests than it can handle.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 4. Virus </font>
				  <p>A virus is a piece of malicious code that is loaded onto a computer without the user's knowledge. It can replicate itself and spread to other computers by attaching itself to other computer files.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 5. Worm </font>
				  <p>Worms are similar to viruses in that they are self-replicating, but they do not need to attach themselves to a program. They are constantly on the lookout for vulnerabilities and report any flaws they find to their creators.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 6. Malware </font>
				  <p>Malware is a broad term used to describe any file or program intended to harm a computer, and includes Trojans, social engineering, worms, viruses and spyware.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 7. Trojans </font>
				  <p>A Trojan is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software, such as a Virus removal program, but performs malicious activity when executed.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 8. Ransomware </font>
				  <p>One of the fastest growing forms of cyber-attacks, Ransomware is a type of malware that demands payment after encrypting the victim's files, making them inaccessible. Be aware that paying the ransom does not guarantee the recovery of encrypted data.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 9. Spyware/adware </font>
				  <p>Spyware/adware can be installed on your computer without your knowledge when you open attachments, click malicious links or download malicious software. It then monitors your computer activity and collects personal information.</p>
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 10. Injection sequel </font>
				  <p>Structured language (SQL) query injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL. SQL injection only works when there is a security vulnerability in the application software.
				  <br>
				  A successful SQL attack will force the server to provide access to or modify the data.</p>
				  
				  <br>
				  <font size="+2"> 11. MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack </font>
				  <p>MITM attacks occur when hackers insert themselves between client (device) and server communications. MITM attacks often occur when a user logs on to an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. Attackers can insert themselves between the visitor's device and the network. The user would then unknowingly pass the information through the attacker.</p>
			  
			  <h4>III - PT SYDECO’S SOLUTIONS</h4>
			  <p>Because antivirus software never responds to the problems created by viruses that have mutated or by new viruses that are born every minute, and because firewalls that are not integrated in a general secure architecture, do not stop the attacks coming from viruses newly created or that have just mutated, each more sophisticated than the last, PT SYDECO has chosen to protect programs, servers and data: PT SYDECO targets the protection of the targets themselves and do not focus on the means used by the attackers, which is what the traditional antivirus programs are tackling, unfortunately always with a time lag, the time to adapt to the new viruses.</p>
			  <p> PT SYDECO's solutions are part of the fight against viruses, namely the use of isolation and protection :
			  <br>
			  	-  Micro-segmentation of the industrial or information network infrastructure will make it possible to isolate the elements likely to be attacked from each other.
<br>
				- Protection around the targets will ensure that they are inoculated against any type of attack.

		  <p>The ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE of the ALL-IN-ONE system, by partitioning the enterprise network into sub-systems, namely the enterprise network, control network and industrial network, which are separated from each other by security devices such as firewalls, ARCHANGEL ONE WAY, reduces the exposure of industrial infrastructure to threats and prepare systems for enhanced installation monitoring and incident detection.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Of course, the security of any device, any server, program, data, depends not only on the element of material protection but also and most importantly on respecting the strict policies governing access to the installation, its use and behavior in case of a problem.</p>
