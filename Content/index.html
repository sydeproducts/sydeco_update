                        <p>The consensus in the literature is that 2021 will be the year of "Ransomware 2.0", with increasingly aggressive attacks (1): The Year of Extortion (2). 
<br>
<br>						
						Cyber attacks are expected to cost the world $11.4 million per minute in 2021.
<br>
<br>
						Some statistics show that the number of global ransomware attacks has increased by 50% compared to last year (1).
<br>
<br>
						Since 2020, there has been a clear trend towards more innovative, smarter malware, applications that look legitimate but are not, and social engineering that is becoming increasingly professional.

				<div class="left-text" align="justify">
					<p>Cyber attacks are becoming more aggressive, more targeted and more sophisticated, with attackers sourcing malware-as-a-service from underground forums (3) :
					</p>
						<p>
						  -	Routine services such as Remote Desktop Protocols (RDPs) and VPN hubs remain a preferred target for attacks at the network perimeter. Attackers use RDPs to move laterally within infiltrated networks (4), <br>
						  -	Attacks on servers: criminals are targeting server platforms that use both Windows and Linux and using them to attack companies from the inside (4), <br>
						  -	Attacks on managed service providers, small businesses and the cloud will increase, <br>
						  -	Cybercriminals will turn more to automation and the number of malware samples will increase (2).
						</p>
							<p>
							It is therefore easy to understand that simple backup and traditional security solutions are no longer sufficient (2).
								<br>
									-	Traditional antivirus software has to deal with frequent changes that require updates that are either late in coming or do not come, but that do not prevent the damage from being done.
								<br>
									-	The firewall alone is no longer sufficient to counter the most sophisticated attacks, as hackers hide malware under deceptive appearances.
								<br>
							</p>
						 		<p>
									Hence the need to implement <strong>epidemiologically inspired approaches</strong> to quantify cyber threats that have not been identified, detected or tracked in order to better address detection, risk assessment and prioritisation gaps (4)
									<br>
									<br>
									Hence, the need to check whether your current security system meets this approach, whether it is based on new technologies with performance commensurate with the risks involved.
									<br>
									<br>
									This approach is all the more necessary in Indonesia as Indonesia is currently known as the world's most vulnerable country that suffers cyber-attacks to their critical infrastructures. The government is working to change the current circumstances and build a stronger cyber defence against the nation's infrastructures (5).
									<br>
									<br>
									<i>“In just 10 shorts months between January and October 2020, Indonesia’s National Cyber And Crypto Agency (Badan Siber dan Sandi Negara/BSSN) has detected a whopping 324 million cyber-attacks targeting Indonesia alone. Cyber-attacks on a global level has also increased tremendously in 2020. BSSN reports that the number of cyber-attacks have increased nearly six-fold compared to the numbers detected in 2019. The top 3 types of attacks are Phishing, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), and Ransomware. The other types of attacks include malware and web defacement attacks” (6)</i>

                                <p>Phishing, an old but still popular tactic, is a social engineering attack that tries to trick people into divulging sensitive or confidential information.

                                <p>Social engineering comes in the form of more than just phishing, but is always used to trick and manipulate victims to gain information or gain access to their computers.

                        <p>Because antivirus software never responds to the problems created by viruses that have mutated or by new viruses that are born every minute, and because firewalls that are not integrated in a general secure architecture, do not stop the attacks coming from viruses newly created or that have just mutated, each more sophisticated than the last, PT SYDECO has chosen to protect programs, servers and data: PT SYDECO targets the protection of the targets themselves and do not focus on the means used by the attackers, which is what the traditional antivirus programs are tackling, unfortunately always with a time lag, the time to adapt to the new viruses.

					<p>PT SYDECO's solutions are part of the fight against viruses, namely the use of isolation and protection :
					</p>
						<p>
						  -	Micro-segmentation of the industrial or information network infrastructure will make it possible to isolate the elements likely to be attacked from each other. <br>
						  -	Protection around the targets will ensure that they are inoculated against any type of attack.<br>
						  
						<h5>PT SYDECO's solution is called ALL-IN-ONE</h5>
					<h5><p>1. ALL IN ONE</p></h5>
					<strong>ALL IN ONE</strong> is THE IT Security Solution from PT SYDECO it is based on the principles of ZERO-TRUST and is designed to prevent cyber-attacks such as Ransomware or data breaches, in the event of an attack, allowing computer networks to continue to function by preventing viruses or worms have any effect and prevent lateral contamination in the tissue. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<strong>All-IN-ONE</strong> IT Security Solution from PT Sydeco focuses on protecting the resources (all data and computing services) of an establishment or enterprise, such as assets, data, services, workflows, networks. Sydeco's ALL-IN-ONE IT Security Solution protects all enterprise assets (devices, applications, virtual and cloud components) and subjects (end users, applications and other non-human entities requesting information from resources).
					<br>
					<br>
					<strong>All-IN-ONE</strong> Cybersecurity Solution from PT Sydeco secures all communications, all data transfers regardless of where the network is located. All-IN-ONE IT Security Solution from PT Sydeco is fully auditable, so that the state of assets as well as the integrity and security posture of all owned and related assets can be observed.
					<br>
					<br>
					PT Sydeco's ALL-IN-ONE IT Security Solution, thanks to its Micro Segmentation Architecture to reduce the attack surface, limits attack impact and prevents lateral contamination within the enterprise.

					<h5> A.	Network Security</h5>
					<p>The company's computer network, in any enterprise or establishment is protected by <strong>ARCHANGEL©</strong>, an advanced firewall created by PT SYDECO which is one of the components of the All-IN-ONE IT Security Solution.</p>
					<p><strong>ARCHANGEL©</strong> protects servers, computers and other connected objects from cyber-attacks originating from the outside world and prevents the spread of lateral virus contamination within the company.</p>
					<p>Servers, computers that are on the company's internal network and which are connected to <strong>ARCHANGEL©</strong> itself are protected by SP-One©.</p>
					<p><strong>SP-One©</strong>, which is another component of the ALL-IN-ONE IT Security Solution, is a program and system that creates an airtight, secure shelter around source code or programs used in office, administration, or university computer networks. Cloud and in SaaS.</p>
					<p><strong>SP-One©</strong> protects servers, programs or Source Code against any cyber-attacks from the outside world and against those coming from within private computer network.</p>

						<br> Figure 2: ALL-IN-ONE (Archangel, SP-One & SST) protect <strong>Servers</strong>
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<p>Enterprise computer network security is enhanced by the ALL-IN-ONE Micro Segmentation Architecture. Thanks to the <strong>Micro Segmentation Architecture</strong>, users can only access the servers they need to work on and after being registered as authorized users.</p>
					<div class="fa-image" align="center">
					<img src="../assets/images/gambar 3.png" height="50%" width="auto" alt="images">
					<br> Figure 3: Zero Trust & Micro Segmentation protect programs <strong>against lateral contamination</strong>
					</div>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>It follows that if a user accidentally or intentionally contaminates his computer, the virus or worm he has downloaded can only try to attack the server he is connected to. And this server is protected by SP-One, so not only the user will not be able to infect the server connected to it but also no other server in the network.</p>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					
					<h5>B.	Mobile Data Security</h5>
					<p>All data moving within the internal network or outside, in the outside world, is protected by SST©, Secure System of Transmission, which is another creation of PT SYDECO, and delivered inside the VPN.
<br>
<br>
					SST© protects data by encrypting it without using a key, without any third party intervention, using artificial intelligence to do so. 
<br>
<br>
					SST© also protects all passwords used in the All-IN-ONE IT Security System. 
<br>
<br>
					VPN are created by ARCHANGEL and encrypted by SST©. 
<br>
<br>
					This is E2E protection and only the receiver can read the data. The data will disappear if someone tries to intercept it.
					</p>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					
					<h5>C.	Security On data at rest</h5>
					<p>Backup Data is protected by SP-One and by Logic Micro Segmentation Architecture used by ALL-IN-ONE systems. Finally all data even when at rest, is encrypted by SST©.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					<h5>D.	Security Of The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Endpoints'</h5>
					<p><strong>ALL-IN-ONE</strong> protects ICS endpoints from SCADA (Monitoring Control And Data Acquisition) or DCS (Distributed Control System) against worms such as StuxNet, or viruses such as ShaMoon or Trojan Horses such as BlackEnergy and will avoid disruptive activities or services. 
<br>
<br>
					<strong>ALL-IN-ONE</strong> protects <strong>ICS ENDPOINTS'</strong> as a whole, servers, communication networks through which data and instructions pass, data itself, terminals and individual components.

<br>
<br>
					Of course, the security of any device, any server, program, data, depends not only on the element of material protection but also and most importantly on respecting the strict policies governing access to the installation, its use and behavior in case of a problem.
